# project-luther-movie-data

This repo contains the [presentation](https://github.com/colekev/project-luther-movie-data/blob/master/luther_project_presentation.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/colekev/project-luther-movie-data/blob/master/project_luther_movie-analysis-Copy1.ipynb) - I plan to revist and clean up once the bootcamp is over - from my first solo project as part of the [12-week data science bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps) at Metis.

You can read more details on my thought process, vizualizations and results at [my blog](https://colekev.github.io/predicting-international-box-office-success/).
